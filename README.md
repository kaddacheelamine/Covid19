# Covid19
The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate several deep learning models for the binary classification of chest X-rays into 'COVID-19' and 'Normal' categories. The project explores custom CNN architectures, hybrid models combining CNNs with traditional machine learning, and transfer learning using state-of-the-art pre-trained models
